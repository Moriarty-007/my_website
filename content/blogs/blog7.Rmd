# Returns of financial stocks

Here is the analysis on Returns of Financial Stock of a select few companies. We utilise the monthly, yearly and daily returns to gauge behaviour of these stock over a fixed period of time. 

```{r load_nyse_data, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}

# Read the dataset
nyse <- read_csv(here::here("data","nyse.csv"))
```

After loading the New York Stock Exchange Data, Let's look at the distribution of companies within different sectors. 
```{r companies_per_sector, fig.width=15, fig.height=8}

#We create a dataframe derived from the nyse dataset which groups by sector and counts the number of observations in each group, then arranges these sector counts in descending order
companies_by_sector <- nyse %>% 
  group_by(sector) %>%
  summarise(count = n()) %>%
  arrange(desc(count))

#We publish these results as a table
kbl(companies_by_sector,col.names=c("Sector","Count")) %>%
kable_styling()

#We produce a bar plot showing the number of companies per sector, in descending order
ggplot(companies_by_sector, aes(y = reorder(sector, desc(-count)), x = count)) + 
  geom_col() + 
  theme(
    title=element_text(size=22, face = "bold"),
    axis.text.x = element_text(size = 10, face="bold"),
    axis.text.y = element_text(size=14, face= "bold")
    ) +
  labs(
    y = "Sector",
    x = "Number of Companies",
    title = 'Number of companies in each Sector'
    )

```





**The nyse dataframe contains a lot of companies but let's analyse the stock behaviour of some of these companies. For the purpose of this analysis, I use _J P Morgan Chase & Co_, _The Walt Disney Company_, _Tesla_, _Exxon_Mobil_, _Abercrombie & Fitch Co._ , _Dominos_Pizza_ and the _SP500_(Exchange Traded Fund).**

```{r get_price_data, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, cache=TRUE}
# Notice the cache=TRUE argument inthe chunk options. Because getting data is time consuming, 
# cache=TRUE means that once it downloads data, the chunk will not run again next time you knit your Rmd

myStocks <- c("JPM","DIS","DPZ","ANF","TSLA","XOM","SPY" ) %>%
  tq_get(get  = "stock.prices",
         from = "2011-01-01",
         to   = "2020-08-31") %>%
  group_by(symbol) 

glimpse(myStocks) # examine the structure of the resulting data frame

```

**(3) - Financial performance analysis depend on returns; If I buy a stock today for 100 and I sell it tomorrow for 101.75, my one-day return, assuming no transaction costs, is 1.75%. So given the adjusted closing prices, our first step is to calculate daily and monthly returns.**

```{r calculate_returns, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, cache=TRUE}

#calculate daily returns
myStocks_returns_daily <- myStocks %>%
  tq_transmute(select     = adjusted, 
               mutate_fun = periodReturn, 
               period     = "daily", 
               type       = "log",
               col_rename = "daily_returns",
               cols = c(nested.col))  

#calculate monthly  returns
myStocks_returns_monthly <- myStocks %>%
  tq_transmute(select     = adjusted, 
               mutate_fun = periodReturn, 
               period     = "monthly", 
               type       = "arithmetic",
               col_rename = "monthly_returns",
               cols = c(nested.col)) 

#calculate yearly returns
myStocks_returns_annual <- myStocks %>%
  group_by(symbol) %>%
  tq_transmute(select     = adjusted, 
               mutate_fun = periodReturn, 
               period     = "yearly", 
               type       = "arithmetic",
               col_rename = "yearly_returns",
               cols = c(nested.col))

```

**(4) - Creating a table where I summarise monthly returns for each of the stocks and `SPY`(Exchange Trade Fund); min, max, median, mean, SD.**

```{r summarise_monthly_returns}

#We group the monthly returns data by symbol, and create the summary variables in summarise, before arranging by mean in descending order
summary_monthly_stock_returns <- myStocks_returns_monthly %>% 
  
  group_by(symbol) %>% 
  
  summarise(min=min(monthly_returns)*100, max=max(monthly_returns)*100,median=median(monthly_returns)*100,mean=mean(monthly_returns)*100,SD=sd(monthly_returns)*100) %>% 
  
  arrange(desc(mean))

#We publish these results as a table
kbl(summary_monthly_stock_returns,col.names=c("Stock Ticker","Minimum Monthly Returns (\\%)","Maximum Monthly Returns (\\%)","Median Monthly Returns (\\%)","Mean Monthly Returns (\\%)","Standard Deviation Monthly Returns (\\%)")) %>%
kable_styling()

```

**(5) - Plot a density plot, using `geom_density()`, for each of the stocks**
```{r density_monthly_returns}

#We create a density plot, with appropriately labelled axes and an appropriate title, faceted by stock ticker
ggplot(myStocks_returns_monthly, aes(x=monthly_returns)) + 
  geom_density() + 
  facet_wrap(~symbol) + 
  labs(x="Monthly Returns", y="Density", title="Density Plot of Monthly Returns for Stock Portfolio & SP500 ETF")

```


The Tesla (TSLA) stock is most risky, since the distribution of monthly returns is widest, showing high variation. Further, it is skewed positively, meaning this variation falls around and below a return of 0.00%. While Abercrombie & Fitch Co. (ANF) may seem similarly risky, this shows a higher peak, and therefore a narrower distribution, meaning less variation in monthly returns. This means it is a more certain, or less risky, investment. 

The least risky stock is Exxon Mobil (XOM), which has the highest peak of all the stock distributions. Despite being centred on a mode value of 0, as this has the narrowest distribution of monthly returns, it carries the highest certainty. 

Though SP500 ETF shows the least risk of all the assets by far, with an extremely narrow distribution, it is an index, not a stock. 

**(6) - Finally, we plot the expected monthly return (mean) of a stock on the Y axis and the risk (standard deviation) in the X-axis.**

```{r risk_return_plot}

#We create a standard scatter plot, labelling axes appropriately
ggplot(summary_monthly_stock_returns, aes(x=SD, y=mean, label=symbol)) + theme_minimal() +
  geom_point(alpha=1) + 
  geom_text_repel() + 
  labs(x="Standard Deviation", y="Mean", title="Relationship Between Mean and Standard Deviation
of Monthly Returns") 

```


This plot demonstrates that there is a generally positive correlation between mean and standard deviation of monthly returns, which is to be expected since investors willing to take on greater risk expect a higher return for it, otherwise the risk is not worth taking on. 

Yet, as we observed in the density plot above, while Abercrombie has high variability in its monthly returns (it is risky), its mean monthly return is actually negative. This, like Exxon Mobil, contradicts the general observed relationship between risk (monthly price variation, SD) and mean return, by having higher-than-expected variation given its low (~0.00%) mean monthly return.
